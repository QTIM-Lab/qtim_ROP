# Possible things we want to do with a set of images

# 1. Create a single dataset for training or testing
# 2. Create an arbitrary split of the dataset into training or testing
# 3. Generate multiple splits for cross-validation
#
# Options:
# * Which pre-processing pipeline to use (YAML file)
# * How much to split training/testing
# * Re-use old splits (CSV file) rather than generating random splits
# * Which reader labels should be used?
